						<p class="break">On a bright spring morning in Chicago’s Montclare neighborhood, Marica Iza greets friends as they gather on her front lawn. They’ve come to celebrate. After four years of uncertainty, Iza can sleep in the tan brick two-flat behind her without fear. No one can prevent her from making her monthly mortgage payments. She can go for a walk around her quiet residential block without worrying a realtor is waiting at the curb. A bank no longer owns her home.</p> 
						<p>Her friends start setting up. A cardboard cutout of a lifesaver rests against the concrete stoop, the words PRINCIPAL REDUCTION painted in red on a white and blue background. Iza’s daughter, Elizabeth, passes out t-shirts, which the guests pull over their clothing. The shirts bear the name and of their community organization, Centro Autónomo, above their logo, a snail in its shell — with a revolutionary fist where the head should be.</p>
						<p>Iza rents her home from Centro Autónomo, which owns both the house and the land it’s built on. The group bought the property for its community land trust, a non-profit program called Casas del Pueblo that aims to take back homes owned by banks and the federal government and provide affordable housing for the community. But even though Centro technically owns the home, members would say it belongs to Iza, and has for the last 14 years.</p>

						<p>When Iza bought this house, at the corner of Nottingham and Barry, in 2001, she saw it as a longterm investment for her young family. She hated the carpet and the ugly green paint on the walls but loved the big backyard and the second floor, which she could rent out. The place had potential, and Iza thought the same way about her future there. Her fingers bled as she knocked down walls and laid new tile, a fact Iza recalls with pride. “Every touch you see here has my energy there.”</p>

					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p>But Iza’s real wounds run deeper. In the same space she toiled to create a home, she fought with her now ex-husband. She describes a decade of domestic abuse in which she suffered financial and emotional manipulation. When she filed for divorce, in September 2010, her husband stopped making mortgage payments. Despite her attempts to negotiate with the bank, Iza’s home fell into foreclosure. As her marriage fell apart, the life she had worked and fought for began to slip away.</p> 
						<p>Stories like this are common at Centro Autónomo. A divorce or illness creates a barrier to payment, and the bank, bound to standard operating procedures, forecloses the home without warning. For Centro members, many of whom are low-income, first-generation immigrants, homeownership has deep significance. It represents both the financial and personal security they associate with becoming an American. Yet many of these dreams are doomed to fail. Only a quarter of the working poor — a socioeconomic grouping that constitutes a majority of first-generation immigrants — manage to transition from renting to owning a home, according to a study from the Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology at the University of Washington. And even when those people get homes, just more than half them lose the property within the first five years of buying it.</p>

						<p>Cases like that are why Antonio Gutierrez, Centro’s 26-year-old housing coordinator, started the community land trust — to form a permanent solution to the housing crisis faced by working-poor immigrants. Buying back Iza’s home from Fannie Mae is Centro’s first victory in that effort, one that has Gutierrez beaming while he shepherds people into a line for a demonstration on Iza’s lawn. As he starts chanting through a megaphone, she and the others respond, their message clear: “What do we do when the banks attack? Stand up! Fight back!”</p>

						<p class="break">Iza’s story is, in many ways, a living example of the American dream. She moved to Chicago from Quito, Ecuador, in 1986, following her brother, who lived in Albany Park at the time. She knew no English and had no firm plans — the promise of opportunity was reason enough for her to leave. Cleaning homes and working at beauty salons helped her pay the rent as she embedded herself into the Northwest side’s Latino community.</p>

					<div class="col-md-5">
						<p>Her brother later suffered a back injury and returned to Ecuador in tk. After living alone for tk years, Iza decided she wanted more stability and decided to marry. When she met her ex-husband, she didn’t think they would ever wed. “I didn’t care for him,” she says, describing the arrangement as one of convenience rather than passion. They bought the home in Montclare together, in 2001, with a down-payment Iza had saved (tk exact amount).</p>

						<p>Both her and her husband’s names were on the title, but the mortgage listed only his. This subtle omission was the first in a series of manipulations by her ex-husband, Iza says, that grew into a decade of financial and emotional abuse. ““You don’t know anybody until you really live with them. You don’t know of anybody’s intentions when you meet somebody.” She stayed in the relationship mostly for her daughter — who Iza had in a prior relationship — hoping to create an example of a strong family.</p> 
						<p>But as the abuse became more severe, Iza began voicing her intention to separate. Her husband responded, she says, by threatening to have her deported. (He is a citizen; she was undocumented at the time.) With help from a social worker, she gained residency, in 2009, through a provision for immigrants in the 1994 Violence Against Women Act. The change in status gave her the security she needed to end the relationship, and in September 2010 she filed for divorce.</p> 
						<p>Her husband retaliated, she says, by exploiting his status as the sole borrower on the mortgage. When the divorce proceedings began, he stopped making payments on the house [tk — he was really willing to sacrifice his credit score for spite?] He then set up a password on the account. This not only prevented Iza from making payments but also invoked protocols that prohibited the bank for even discussing the mortgage with her — even though her listing on the title allowed her to be summoned to foreclosure court. [tk — exact numbers for payments, etc. to illustrate financial distress]</p> 
						<p>[Maybe it’s the 0235 talking, but instead of explaining how foreclosure works with words right about here, a graphic or animation might just do the trick.]</p> 
						<p>The legal complexity of this frustrated Iza, but she did everything in her power to find answers. “I was knocking on every door that I would think there was a possibility of somebody to listen to me.” Inside, however, she struggled to persevere. Iza entered a deep depression. She would break down crying during the middle of the day, sometimes finding it hard to even get out of bed in the morning.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="col-md-5">
						<p>In addition to the financial and emotional stress of divorce and foreclosure, Iza feared social reprimand. During that period, she told no one she was losing her home. Even trying to speak about it reduced her to tears. Her morning walks, normally a respite, became tinged with anxiety — that she would come home to a new notice, that her neighbors knew her embarrassing secret.</p>
						<p>“Your eyes are trained on the door hoping there will be no sign, nothing hanging on the door. It was just like that, you feel like you're a criminal because you are being treated like one. When you have your house in foreclosure it's like you have a sign on your forehead that says you’ve been foreclosed and everybody knows. It is such a sense of embarrassment. It is just unbearable.”</p>

						<p>Just as Iza’s old family collapsed, she gained a new one. On a day off from work, a friend encouraged her to come take computer classes at Centro Autónomo. Centro is the Albany Park community center. It educates members of the community, and it also helps members with foreclosures and evictions. Centro, located on a bustling part of West Lawrence Avenue, also advocates for better housing policy at a national level.</p> 
						<p>Iza and her friend went up the flight of stairs that leads to the center that evening to find that the class had been cancelled. In another room, the housing coordinator at the time, Robero Tk, was holding a workshop on foreclosure rights. With her evening open, Iza decided to stop in.</p>
						<img src="img/circle.jpg" style="width: 100%" alt="">
						<p class="break">Sitting in a makeshift circle of swivel chairs and couches in Centro’s office she listened to families cry as they recounted stories like her own [Someone should check this setting]. Others had fallen behind on mortgage payments because a family member had fallen ill and couldn’t work; divorce had left mothers like Iza alone in their homes struggling to support their children. Instead of feeling alone and hopeless, Iza realized she was one of many.</p>
						<p>After hearing other families asking for help to keep their homes, she shared her story, too. Though Iza doesn’t live in Albany Park, Centro Autónomo helped organize a protest in front of the Wells Fargo downtown. The bank opened an investigation into Iza’s case, allowing her to explain her situation.</p>
						<p>Each opportunity to share her story empowered Iza, leading her to testify twice before Fannie Mae in Washington, D.C. The first time, in January 2012, she met with the vice president of Fannie Mae in a private session as part of a national group of community organizations seeking housing policy reform. Little came of the meeting. Each person spoke for their allotted two minutes, received assurance the agency would look into the case—and nothing more.</p>
						<p>Iza walked away with no progress on her home. But the meeting was an important first step. Fannie Mae had never before sat down with residents of foreclosed homes with the intent of even considering new options for their cases. Instead of feeling defeated, Iza felt empowered. “I thought to myself, ‘If I can go this meeting, if I can talk to these executives, I can do it another time, and I can do it better.’”</p>
						<p>When she returned to Washington D.C. three years later, she was determined to come back with results. “I had a sense of entitlement,” she says smiling. “I thought, ‘You know what? You’re not taking my home.’” Around a conference table at the Federal Housing Finance Agency, she and 11 other immigrants told their stories to agency director Mel Watt.</p>

						<p>Unlike Iza’s previous visit, Watt listened to every story in full, even taking time to speak with each person one-on-one after the meeting. When he got to Iza, she took his hand in hers and told him she refused to leave without some form of progress. Watt gave her the name of someone in the agency who, he assured, would help with her specific case.</p>

					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p>The victory elated and exhausted Iza. Antonio worried that she might faint.</p>
						<p>Four years after the foreclosure, Fannie Mae gave Iza an offer: Centro Autonomo could buy the house back at the reduced cost of $225,000 — $25,000 less than the initial offer. Antonio decided the price was low enough and they accepted the deal.</p>
						<p>Iza’s granddaughter TK is TK years old. Someday, Iza hopes that her granddaughter will be able to know what Iza had to do to fight for her home. “I have the privilege to live here,” Iza says. “I have a piece of land in America.” I want this house to have history. I want for my granddaughter to say one day, ‘My grandmother fought for this, and I have the privilege to live here. I have a piece of land in America.’”</p>
