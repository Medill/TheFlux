							<h1>  </h1>
							<p> On a Monday evening in April, Patrick Rochford and his eight students sat in the basement of the American Indian Association of Illinois feasting on chewy dumplings in sweet grape sauce, a traditional Cherokee dish that he prepared for a pre-lesson potluck. </p>

							<p> Patrick donned a beaded bracelet and a navy Cherokee Nation t-shirt. He smiled as his eager students, none of them Cherokee, attempted, sometimes in vain, to repeat after him. One of the subjects covered in April’s class was weather, and Patrick taught his students a few Cherokee phrases that are particularly useful in Chicago’s early spring. </p>

							<p> “Tla y-uganawa” means it’s not warm. “Dv-ga-hna-ni” means it’s going to rain. </p>

							<p> His students seemed to be there in equal parts to learn the language, have fun and support a young person from their community who is in touch with his culture. At 22, Patrick says he knows fewer than 10 people around his age with whom he can converse in Cherokee. </p> 

							<p> Like most Americans, Patrick is of mixed heritage. He inherited an olive complexion from his maternal grandfather, whose family came to the United States from Southern Italy in the early 20th century. He feels more deeply connected, though, to his Cherokee heritage which comes from his maternal grandmother. “To me, it’s a culture and a way of life that makes sense,” he explains. “Indigenous communities are very family oriented. They take care of each other.” </p>
						</div>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-1">
								<img src="img/example" data-src="img/patrick2.png" class="img-responsive gif"/>
								<h4>"If we lose our language, we lose who we are" - Patrick</h4>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-5">
								<p> Though Patrick’s father is non-Native, it was his dad who bought him his first Cherokee language book when he was 9 years old. “It was this little beginner Cherokee book,” Patrick recalls. He didn’t grow up around the language so picking up the sounds and tones was particularly difficult. </p>

								<p> Twelve years later, the language now plays an important role in Patrick’s life. His passion for it is what brings him to the Association each month to work with his pupils who, though few in number, are full of enthusiasm. </p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">

								<p> In the last few minutes of April's class, one young student raised her hand. "How do you say Ninja Turtle?" she asked, as the room erupted in laughter. </p>

								<p> "Ninja-daksi," Patrick replied. (Not surprisingly there's no Cherokee word for ninja.) </p>

								<p> Though the lesson is meant to be fun, Patrick is serious about sharing his love of the language that it took him years to master. </p>

								<p> After Patrick completed his beginner book, he began taking language classes online, but it wasn’t until 2011, when he was 16, that he really experienced Cherokee first-hand. That year he traveled to Tahlequah, Oklahoma for the first time. Nestled at the foothills of the Ozark Mountains, Tahlequah became the capital of Cherokee Nation in 1843. According to legend, its name is derived from the Cherokee word "ta'ligwu,” which means “just two” and refers to the two tribal elders who selected the land as their home after the Trail of Tears. </p>
							
							<p> At the conference, Patrick attended a Cherokee language panel. Though he was still a novice speaker at the time, he understood enough of the language to decipher most of what the panelists said. One statement in particular stuck with him: “If we lose our language, we lose who we are.” </p>

							<p> That's when Patrick realized how important it was for him to really learn Cherokee. </p>

							<p> At moments, Patrick feared he might never master it. Cherokee uses a syllabary, a key that functions like an alphabet of sounds, and it’s a very specific language. For example, the verb “to wear” changes depending on what article of clothing your subject is sporting.  </p>

							<p> Patrick’s quest to learn the language took him back to Tahlequah two years after his initial visit. He enrolled in a two-year Cherokee language program at Northeastern State University, a school in the heart of Cherokee Nation that is home to more American Indian students than any other four-year public university in the country. </p>

						</div>
						
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-2">

							<p> For Patrick, the school held a special significance: Though Illinois is home to over 1,000 registered Cherokees, he didn’t know anyone back home who could speak the language. When strangers were skeptical of his claim to be Cherokee – after all, celebrities from Bill Clinton to Miley Cyrus have claimed Cherokee blood – his language skills cleared the air. “It helped me gain acceptance,” he says. </p>

							</div>
							<div class="col-md-4">
								<h4>"A lot of people think that American Indians don’t even exist… we’re only something that can be studied in one paragraph of a history book." -Patrick</h4>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">

							<p> Now back in Chicago, Patrick is a senior at DePaul University majoring in international studies with a focus on indigenous cultures. He hasn’t lost his connection to Tahlequah, however. Sometimes he even calls to chat with the tribe’s translators to get his fix of the language. Ultimately, Patrick wants to work in tribal language revitalization, because he believes language is at the heart of ethos. </p>

							<p> Many American Indian traditions are tied to specific places. For example, visiting the Stomp Grounds, religious gathering places where men dance as women keep rhythm, is one of the things Patrick misses most about Tahlequah. Nothing like the Stomp Grounds exists in Chicago. But language, Patrick contends, is a good way for urban American Indians to connect with their cultures even if they can’t participate in site-specific customs. </p>

							<p> Cherokee Nation was one of the first tribes to offer online language classes like the ones Patrick took, and in May, Cherokee became available on Android devices after staff from the tribe’s Language Programs department spent two years translating over 50,000 technology terms into Cherokee. Though Cherokee Nation work’s hard to protect it, the language’s fate ultimately rests in the hands of young people like Patrick. </p>

							<p> Patrick’s monthly classes may not attract many students, but the ones who do attend can’t help but appreciate the excitement their teacher has for sharing Cherokee. Though in many ways he’s is fighting an uphill battle when it comes to spreading the language, that won’t stop Patrick from trying even if it’s a matter of reaching just eight students at a time. </p>

						<p> The first thing she noticed about the big city was the noise. Airplanes overhead, cars on the street, the sirens would wake her up at night. The second thing she noticed was the heat, the “jungle heat,” 20 degrees higher in the summer than in her 500-person hometown on Whitefish Lake in Ontario, Canada. </p>

						<p> After living in Chicago for 15 years now, neither the noise nor the heat bothers Jody Roy anymore. </p>

						<p> The 37-year-old is a full-time business student at Kendall College. She’s a native Canadian and Ojibwe Indian from the Atikameksheng Anishnawbek First Nation. (Yes, she can say it. No, even she can’t spell it – not without looking it up.) She’s a wife and a mother: Her husband Eric is a 42-year-old commercial and industrial painter, and her 18-year-old daughter Jade is graduating from North Park’s Von Steuben Metropolitan Science Center in June. Perhaps Jody is just too busy to notice the big city’s distractions anymore. </p>
						</div>

								<h4>When Eric was offered a job in Chicago, he couldn’t pass it up – and suddenly, the trio found themselves living next to a much larger lake.</h4>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-5">

						<p> She notices them when she returns to the reservation every August, though, to her retired parents, older brother, TK# nieces and nephews. Somewhere along the 450 mile trip, the fast-paced world takes a deep breath and relaxes. And when she arrives, she can actually see the stars, white dots shining brighter on a black sky than any city-slicker could ever imagine. Lying on the powwow grounds, watching the meteor showers reminds Jody of her youth: the hours spent tree-hopping, the days spent camping, the weeks and months spent in the lake from after breakfast until the sun went down.  “I was a fish,” she laughs. </p>
					</div>
						<divs class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">

						<p> When Eric got a job painting with his brother in Chicago in 2000, Jody and Jade went with him. Jade was three years old, and her urban upbringing has been somewhat different than her mother’s. “In the city, I could not let Jade outside,” Jody remembers. “I’d have to be with her wherever she went. Even when I had to go into the house for something, I would drag her by the door, ‘Wait, I have to get something,’ then go back outside. I was like a helicopter parent.” </p>

						<p> Some of the carefree childhood Jody wished to impart had to fall by the wayside. On the reservation, kids ride their bikes everywhere; not teaching Jade how to ride a bike is one of Jody’s biggest regrets. The relief in her voice is tangible when she says Jade is picking it up quickly as an 18-year-old. </p>

						<p> But it’s worth it, every single moment is worth it, because the schools in Chicago are just plain better. Jade’s coursework is consistently heavier and more advanced than that of cousins in Ontario. “Can I move to Grandma’s to go to high school?” Jade once complained. “No,” came Jody’s answer. “It’ll pay off in the long run.” </p>

						<p> And it is paying off. Jade will be attending Wilbur Wright College in the fall, with plans to eventually transfer to the University of Illinois at Chicago. She’ll likely major in math, perhaps with the eventual goal of becoming a math teacher in Chicago. Would she still be going to college if she’d stayed on the reservation? “That’s a tough call,” Jody says. “That’s really tough.” </p>

						</div>
					<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-2">
						<p> After all, Jody’s own schooling was interrupted by having a daughter at 18. She spent her first years in Chicago helping at a daycare before volunteering and eventually working a full-time at a church, the Anawim Spiritual Center for Native Americans, for seven years. The 2007-2009 recession brought Jody back to Canada in 2011 for a more lucrative research assistant position at the First Nations Food, Nutrition and Environment Study; she sent her paychecks back to Eric and Jade in Chicago. Economic stability and a collegiate opportunity brought her back a year later. </p>
						</div>
							<div class="col-md-4">
								<img src="img/example" data-src="img/jody env2.jpg" class="img-responsive gif"/>
								<h4>When times got tough, the reservation pulled Jody out and set her back on her feet.</h4>
							</div>
					<divs class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">


						<p> She’s totally weirded out by the fact that her daughter will also be in college in the fall. “It just makes me feel old,” she laughs ruefully. “But it’s never too late to get your education. It’s just bettering the family.” </p>

						<p> That could be interpreted metaphorically, but Jody hopes her business degree will better her family in a direct way: She and Eric hope to form their own family-run venture, a Union paint shop. Eric’s coworkers tell him that it would be the first in Chicago to be run by an American Indian, let alone an American Indian woman (technically, of course, she’s Canadian). “That has the advantage of getting [certain] contracts,” Jody says. </p>

						<p> And despite the nostalgia, the memories of growing up on that lake in Ontario, the Roys only plan on staying where they are. Mother, father and daughter all have stronger ties to Chicago than the quaint town of two blocks and a main road where Jody used to live. They’ll visit, of course, every August like they already do. But the reservation is no longer home. That distinction belongs to the city. </p>

						<p> Carlos sat at his cluttered work table and flipped the pages of a thin hardcover book until he found the one he was searching for. He held it up and pointed to a black and white photo of a Hopi man holding a rattlesnake in his mouth as he practiced a traditional rain dance. “Have you ever seen this before?” he asked. </p>

						<p> Carlos spent his early years in Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico, and he remembers scenes like this from his childhood. </p>

						<p> Carlos, now 68, has a friendly face. He wears glasses and has grey ponytail that he usually covers with a flat cap. He tends to speak quietly, but it’s certainly worth learning in to hear him. He has lots of interesting stories to tell. </p>

								<h4>The Indian Relocation Act encouraged American Indians to move off-reservation and assimilate.</h4>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-5">

						<p> Carlos lived in Zuni Pueblo until he was 10. That’s when his parents sent him to live with his aunt and uncle in Isleta. His parents had eight children of their own, but his aunt and uncle had none, so Carlos helped them cook, clean and take care of their orchard, all the while learning the customs of the Isleta Tribe. In a way, he belongs to both cultures. </p>

						<p> Today, he lives in Chicago thanks to the Indian Relocation Act, which encouraged American Indians to move off-reservation and assimilate into urban environments throughout the ‘50s and ‘60s. The program was known for promising many American Indians better lives, and not always delivering. </p>
					</div>
						<divs class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">

						<p> Carlos received his first application for relocation shortly after he graduated from high school, and he tore it up without thinking twice. At the time, he was playing in a band that he hoped would be the first American Indian group to appear on the Ed Sullivan Show. The group, called the Thunderbirds, sold its record throughout the Southwest. Non-Native audiences, however, often stereotyped the band. When they wanted to audition for Ed Sullivan, for example, the band members were asked to don war bonnets, a type of feather headdress, that’s not worn by pueblo tribes. </p>

						<p> Despite the challenges the Thunderbirds faced, Carlos was committed to making it with his band. His life was in Isleta and he didn’t want to leave, but his aunt had other ideas. Carlos had done well in high school, and he was more ambitious than his brothers and sisters. There weren’t many job opportunities in Isleta, and his aunt thought that Carlos could do better for himself in the city. </p>

						<p> What his aunt wanted, his aunt got. Chicago was one of seven sites that were available for relocation, and as a result, it still has the third-highest off-reservation native population of any city in the country. Carlos knew a few other people from Isleta who had moved to the Midwest on relocation, so he selected it as his first choice. </p>

						<p> By the time he arrived in the Windy City, most of those people had already returned home. But, Carlos decided to stay. While others found the transition from reservation to city life challenging, Carlos loved the change. “When I got here, it was like heaven,” he says. </p>

						<p> Carlos attended Greer Technical Institute in Braidwood, Illinois, where he learned to repair heavy machinery. After completing that program he moved into the YMCA on South Wabash Avenue, his first home in the city, and began his 18-year career as a mechanic which lasted until industrial jobs started to leave the city. He had grown attached to Chicago and didn’t want to leave with them, so he found odd jobs that allowed him to stay in the area. Today he collects a pension from the union to which he belonged. </p>

						<p> Though Chicago is 1,300 miles from his New Mexico home, Carlos has never abandoned his American Indian culture. Over the past five decades, he’s played with a multiple local drum groups, as well as a Native rock band called the Chicago Thunderbirds, a name he brought with him from Isleta. In 1984 he founded the Black Hawk Performance Group, which is now the oldest American Indian dance group in Chicago. </p>

						<p> The Black Hawk Performance Group has lasted so long, in part, due to its close relationship with the American Indian Association and even holds practice for young drummers in the Association’s basement. There are over 150 tribes represented in the Chicago area, and the Black Hawk Performance Group’s diverse makeup is represented by the songs and oral histories it performs in five languages across all of Chicago. One of Carlos’s favorite memories was when the group performed at a Chicago Bulls playoff game. He got to see Michael Jordan without paying for a ticket. </p>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-2">
						<p> Carlos also practices traditional Native cooking and art. He created his own elaborate dance regalia – it takes an hour to put on – by hand. He devotes much of his time to his creative pursuits, and he lives just a few blocks from the Association where he both volunteers and keeps much of his craft supplies. He recently created a rattlesnake from a coiled gourd shell, resplendent with painted stripes and a beaded tail. He also uses the shells to create beautiful painted shakers. </p>
					</div>
							<div class="col-md-4">
								<img src="img/example" data-src="img/carlos env2.jpg" class="img-responsive gif"/>
								<h4>“When I got [to Chicago], it was like heaven” - Carlos </h4>
							</div>
					<divs class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">

						<p> Carlos smiles as he recalls the story of how one of his shakers nearly got the Association’s director, Dorene Wiese, arrested. She tried to give it to Barak Obama after a town hall meeting, but instead was quickly surrounded by secret service agents. After she explained to them that it was a gift, one of the agents took it and assured her he’d pass it along to the president. </p>

						<p> Though Carlos still feels connected to Isleta and Zuni, he admits that both have changed considerably since he left New Mexico 50 years ago. Isleta now has sidewalks and ponds full of fish. Its new houses make it look more like a suburb than a reservation. In Zuni, few of the boys go through the challenging tribal initiation that Carlos completed when he was 6. Instead, they’re more interested in television. Still, he calls them home. His cousin, Benjamin, is a war captain at Isleta and his sisters still live in Zuni.  </p>

						<p> “Other than that,” Carlos says, “this is my home.” </p>

						<p> Get up, you can’t die here Melanie told herself. She was laying in an alley after being shot by a member of a rival gang. The bullet had entered her back and tore straight through her chest. She’d later find out that it had missed her heart by just two inches.</p>

						<p> Melanie Cloud, then 19, grew up in Rogers Park, a Northside neighborhood that was a hotbed of gang violence. She knew there was a gas station at the corner of Devon and Bell, and it was there she ran for help. When she arrived, the attendant was asleep. She banged on the door, but failed to wake him. She did attract the attention of a local drug addict who came over to find out what was happening. “Oh my god, Smiles, are you ok?” the woman asked Melanie, calling her by her neighborhood nickname. After Melanie answered that she had been shot, the woman grew too hysterical to even call for help. </p>

								<h4>"Though most people don’t realize Chicago is home to a significant American Indian community, that doesn’t mean the community is immune to the city’s violence." - Melanie</h4>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-5">

							<p> Melanie was freezing cold and covered in blood by the time her friends found her. </p>

							<p> She was conscious for the entire six-mile ambulance ride down Lakeshore Drive from Rogers Park to Illinois Masonic Medical Center. She recognized members of the hospital’s emergency room crew. They were the same doctors and nurses who had treated her months earlier, after a stab wound had punctured one of her lungs. </p>

							<p> “What’s the matter with you Melanie?” they asked. “It hasn’t even been a year and you’re already back here.” </p>

							</div>

						<p> Though most people don’t realize Chicago is home to a significant American Indian community, that doesn’t mean the community is immune to the city’s violence. Melanie is a registered member of the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, but, as a teenager, she was also a member of one of the country’s largest Hispanic street gangs, Latin King and Queen Nation. Several major injuries and a few misdemeanors didn’t convince Melanie to leave the gang, instead it was becoming pregnant with her first son, Ethan that made Melanie change her ways. She left the gang, got her GED and enrolled at the city’s American Indian college. </p>

						<p> Melanie, now 37, had to overcome obstacles to build the life she has today. Her single mother, though loving and attentive, had to work long hours just to make ends meet. She dropped out of high school when she was 16, and nearly died 3 years later. But all of that is in the past.  </p>

						<p> Now, she usually dons a dark t-shirt and leggings, a comfortable uniform for a mother of three. Her long dark hair is typically pulled back, and she’s tall (5-foot-11), but looks especially so when she stands next to her husband, Adam, who is 5-foot-8. Smiles could still be her nickname. Not only is she usually wearing one herself, but she also has no trouble eliciting them from others with her quick wit. </p>

						<p> Melanie is one of 40,000 American Indians living in Chicago. It’s a group whose experience, in many ways, is akin to that of other minorities. High rates of poverty and incarceration, and low graduation rates plague the community. In 2012, American Indians earned 30 percent less than the national average and they were twice as likely to lack health insurance. When addressing these concerns in the urban American Indian community, however, it’s important to remember that Native Americans are different from other minority groups. They have a different legal status, and there is a special government office, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, that’s dedicated to dealing with their concerns. </p> 

						<p> While the Bureau has comprehensive plans for addressing the needs of on-reservation American Indians (their efficacy aside), according to the American Indian Association of Illinois’s director, Dorene Wiese, urban Natives receive few of the Bureau’s resources. Dorene says most funding from the Bureau is delegated through tribes, who tend to put that money back into their reservations. </p>

						<p> As a result, many of Chicago’s American Indians rely on pan-Indian organizations for both human service needs and cultural enrichment. These types of organizations were crucial to Melanie as she transitioned into her new life, but today, many of them struggle to maintain the funding they need to survive. The building that houses the American Indian Center of Chicago, for example, is decrepit. If the organization is not able to find an affordable new home, it may disband. The Association, where Melanie works, faces similar hardships. </p>

<divs class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
						<p> Melanie handles everything from the Association’s accounting to running its Native Scholars Program, a weekly afterschool session where young American Indians can both get extra homework help and learn about native culture. Her three children are among the group of about 12 who attend the session regularly. </p>

						<p> You don’t have to spend much time with Melanie and her children to see just how much she loves them. She credits them with saving her life. </p>

						<p> “When I was younger, I didn’t think I’d live to be 21,” she admits. </p> 

						<p> Like Melanie, her kids are true Northsiders. Her son, Ethan, even plays on a little league team called the Cubs that holds its games in a park not far from where Melanie grew up. On a sunny April afternoon, Melanie and her family gathered to watch his first game of the season. Down by two in the bottom of the final inning, the Cubs, who clearly don’t take after their Major League namesake, managed to claw their way to a comeback victory over the Edgebrook Mets. As the team met at the mound to celebrate, Melanie looked on proudly. She cherishes these types of moments knowing that without Ethan, she might not be here today. Sometimes Melanie still feels pain near where the bullet entered the left side of her chest, but she says it’s nothing she can’t manage. </p>
