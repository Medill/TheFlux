						<p class="lead"> Carlos sat at his cluttered work table and flipped the pages of a thin hardcover book until he found the one he was searching for. He held it up and pointed to a black and white photo of a Hopi man holding a rattlesnake in his mouth as he practiced a traditional rain dance. “Have you ever seen this before?” he asked. </p>

						<p> Carlos Parsino spent his early years in Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico, and he remembers scenes like this from his childhood. </p>

						<p> Carlos, now 68, has a friendly face. He wears glasses and has a grey ponytail that he usually covers with a flat cap. He tends to speak quietly, but it’s certainly worth leaning in to hear him. He has lots of interesting stories to tell. The picture he shared reminded him of one in particular. </p>

						</div> 

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-1">

								<blockquote><p>When I got [to Chicago], it was like heaven.</p></blockquote>
								</div>
							</div>
						<div class="col-md-4">

						<p> When he was very young, Carlos and his brothers found a rattlesnake coiled outside of the front door of their family home. They decided to throw rocks at it, but their father interceded. “Don’t do that,” he told them. Instead their dad grabbed the family’s sacred corn meal and knelt before the snake. He said a prayer to it, and poured a path of corn meal that led out of their yard. The snake, to Carlos’s surprise, followed it. His father explained that the snake could have been one of the family’s ancestors reincarnated. It’s a memory he’s carried with him his whole life. </p>

						</div>
						<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">


						<p> Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico, is a speck of a town 150 miles west of Albuquerque. It was there Carlos, a member of the Zuni Tribe, lived with his parents and siblings until he was 10 years old. That’s when he was sent to live with his aunt and uncle, who had no children of their own, in Isleta. Just 15 miles from Albuquerque, it was there that Carlos was first exposed to city life. He helped his aunt and uncle cook, clean and take care of their fruit orchard, all the while learning the customs of the Isleta Tribe. In a way, he belongs to both cultures. </p>
					
						<p> Today, he lives in Chicago thanks to the Indian Relocation Act, which encouraged American Indians to move off-reservation and assimilate into urban environments throughout the ‘50s and ‘60s. The program was known for promising many American Indians better lives, and not always delivering.</p>

						<p> Carlos received his first application for relocation shortly after he graduated from Rio Grande High School in Albuquerque, and he tore it up without thinking twice. At the time, he was playing in a band that he hoped would be the first American Indian group to appear on the <em> Ed Sullivan Show</em>. The group, called the Thunderbirds, sold its record throughout the Southwest. Non-Native audiences, however, often stereotyped the group, requesting they play songs with titles like “Chief Whooping Cough.” When they wanted to audition for Ed Sullivan, for example, the band members were asked to don war bonnets, a type of feather headdress, that’s not worn by pueblo tribes.</p>

						</div>
					<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-3">

						<p> Despite the challenges the Thunderbirds faced, Carlos was committed to making it with his band. His life was in Isleta and he didn’t want to leave, but his aunt had other ideas. Carlos had done well in high school, and he was more ambitious than his brothers and sisters. There weren’t many job opportunities in Isleta, and his aunt thought that Carlos could do better for himself in the city. </p>

					</div>
							<div class="col-md-4">
								<div id="profilefact">
									<p>There are over 150 federally registered tribes represented in the Chicago area.</p>
									<img src="img/example" data-src="img/tilespullfacts.jpg" class="img-responsive gif"/>
									
								</div>
							</div>
					<divs class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">

						<p> What his aunt wanted, his aunt got. Chicago was one of seven sites that were available for relocation, and as a result, it still has the third-highest off-reservation native population of any city in the country. Carlos knew a few other people from Isleta who had moved to the Midwest on relocation, so he selected it as his first choice. </p>

						<p> By the time he arrived in the Windy City, most of the people who had gone to Chicago on relocation had already returned home. But, Carlos decided to stay. While others found the transition from reservation to city life challenging, Carlos loved the change. “When I got here, it was like heaven,” he says.</p>

						<p> Carlos attended Greer Technical Institute in Braidwood, Illinois, where he learned to repair heavy machinery. After completing that program he moved into the YMCA on South Wabash Avenue, his first home in the city, and began his 18-year career as a mechanic which lasted until industrial jobs started to leave the area in the 1980s. He had grown attached to Chicago and didn’t want to leave with them, so he found odd jobs that allowed him to stay. Today he collects a pension from the union to which he belonged, and he volunteers at the American Indian Association of Illinois. </p>

						<p> Though Chicago is 1,300 miles from his New Mexico home, Carlos has never abandoned his American Indian culture. Over the past five decades, he’s played with a multiple local drum groups, as well as a Native rock band called the Chicago Thunderbirds, a name he brought with him from Isleta. In 1984 he founded the Black Hawk Performance Group, which is now the oldest American Indian dance group in Chicago.</p>

								</figure>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-4">
						<p> The Black Hawk Performance Group has lasted so long, in part, due to its close relationship with the Association and even holds practice for young drummers in the Association’s basement. There are over 150 tribes represented in the Chicago area, and the Black Hawk Performance Group’s diverse makeup is represented by the songs and oral histories it performs in five languages across all of Chicago. One of Carlos’s favorite memories was when the group performed at a Chicago Bulls playoff game. He got to see Michael Jordan without paying for a ticket. He created his beautiful blue dance regalia by hand. It takes over an hour just to put on the suit that’s covered in elaborate bead and feather work. </p>

						</div>
						<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">

						<p> Carlos also makes rattlesnakes, like the one he recalls from his childhood, that he crafts from coiled gourd shells. His most recent conception is resplendent with painted stripes and a beaded tail. The shells, he found, can also be used to create shakers.</p>

						<p> Carlos smiles as he recalls the story of how one of his shakers nearly got the Association’s director, Dorene Wiese, arrested. She tried to give it to Barak Obama after a town hall meeting, but instead was quickly surrounded by secret service agents. After she explained to them that it was a gift, one of the agents accepted it and assured her he’d pass it along to the president. Carlos and Dorene have also given his gourds to former-mayor Richard M. Daley and Harry Belafonte, among other dignitaries. </p>

						<p> Occasionally, Carlos returns to New Mexico, and when he does, he can’t believe how much has changed. Isleta now has sidewalks and ponds full of fish. Its new houses make it look more like a suburb than a reservation. The orchard he worked on as a teenager is gone. In Zuni, few of the boys go through the challenging tribal initiation that Carlos completed when he was 6. During initiation boys aren’t allowed to speak English, only Zuni, but few young people even learn their tribal language these days. Despite these changes, Zuni and Isleta are still home in some ways. </p>

						<p> “Other than that,” Carlos says, “this is my home.” </p>

						<p class="lead"> <em>Get up, you can’t die here</em> Melanie told herself. She was laying in an alley after being shot by a member of a rival gang. The bullet had entered her back and torn straight through her chest. She’d later find out that it had missed her heart by just two inches. </p>

						<p> Melanie Cloud, then 19, had grown up in Rogers Park, Chicago’s northernmost neighborhood, which was home to its share of gang violence. As she lay there, she thought about where to go for help. She knew there was a gas station at the corner of Devon and Bell, just a block from the alley, and it was there she went. </p>

								</blockquote>
								</div>
							</div>
						<div class="col-md-4">

						<p> When she arrived, the attendant was asleep. She banged on the door, but failed to wake him. She did attract the attention of a local drug addict who came over to find out what was happening. “Oh my god, Smiles, are you ok?” the woman asked Melanie, calling her by her neighborhood nickname. After Melanie answered that she had been shot, the woman grew too frantic to even call for help. </p>

						<p> Melanie was freezing cold and covered in blood by the time her friends found her in front of the gas station. “I’m getting cold,” she told them, as they called for help. </p>

						</div>
						<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">

						<p> She was conscious for the entire six-mile ambulance ride down Lakeshore Drive from Rogers Park to Illinois Masonic Medical Center. She recognized members of the hospital’s emergency room crew. They were the same doctors and nurses who had treated her months earlier, after a stab wound had punctured one of her lungs. </p>

						<p> “What’s the matter with you Melanie?” they asked. “It hasn’t even been a year and you’re already back here.” </p>

						<p> Melanie is a registered member of the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, but, as a teenager, she was also a member of one of the country’s largest Hispanic street gangs, Latin King and Queen Nation. Several major injuries and a few misdemeanors didn’t convince Melanie to leave the gang, instead it was becoming pregnant with her first son, Ethan that made Melanie change her ways. She left the gang, studied for her GED and eventually graduated from the city’s American Indian college. </p> 

						<p> Melanie, now 37, had to overcome obstacles to build the life she has today. Her single mother, though loving and attentive, had to work long hours just to make ends meet. Melanie dropped out of high school when she was 16, and nearly died 3 years later. But all of that is in the past. </p>

						</div>
					<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-3">

						<p> Now a mother of three always on the go, Melanie usually wears a dark t-shirt and leggings that fit her allow her to keep up with her kids. Her new look is a far cry from her younger years spent in the black and gold gang colors of the Latin Kinds. She used to have a tattoo of the gang’s symbol near her left wrist, but it’s been covered by a rose. Her long dark hair is typically pulled back. She’s tall, 5-foot-11, but looks especially so when she stands next to her husband, Adam, who is 5-foot-8. Smiles could still be her nickname. Not only is she usually wearing one herself, but she also has no trouble eliciting them from others with her quick wit. </p>

						<p> Melanie is one of 40,000 American Indians living in Chicago. It’s a group whose experience, in many ways, is akin to that of other minorities. High rates of poverty, violence, incarceration, and low graduation rates plague the community. In 2012, American Indians earned 30 percent less than the national average and they were twice as likely to lack health insurance. When addressing these concerns in the urban American Indian community, however, it’s important to remember that Native Americans are different from other minority groups. They have a different legal status, and there is a special government office, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, that’s dedicated to dealing with their concerns. </p> 

						<p> According to the American Indian Association of Illinois’s director, Dorene Wiese, urban Natives receive few of the Bureau’s resources. Dorene says most funding from the Bureau is delegated through tribes, who tend to put that money back into their reservations. </p>

						<p> As a result, many of Chicago’s American Indians rely on pan-Indian organizations for both human service needs and cultural enrichment. These types of organizations were crucial to Melanie as she transitioned into her new life, but today, many of them struggle to maintain the funding they need to survive. NAES College, the school from which Melanie graduated, was once the only urban American Indian college in the country. It’s since dissolved due to lack of funding. And, this winter the American Indian Center of Chicago experienced trouble with the boiler and heating ducts in its building that caused it to suspend several of its services. Repairs could cost the already financially-strapped organization over $100,000. The Association, where Melanie works, faces similar hardships. </p>

								<p> Melanie handles everything from the Association’s accounting to running its Native Scholars Program, a weekly afterschool session where young American Indians can both get extra homework help and learn about native culture. Her three children are among the group of about 12 who attend the session regularly. At a Native Scholars session in May, Melanie helped her twins, Evian and Eric with their long division, her affection for them clearly on display – she credits her kids with saving her life. </p>
							</div>

						<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">

						<p> “When I was younger, I didn’t think I’d live to be 21,” she admits. </p>

						<p> Melanie is a true Northsider – she won’t even buy White Sox tickets – and her kids have taken after her. Her son Ethan is even a member of a little league team called the Cubs that plays in a park not far from where Melanie grew up. </p>

						<p> On a sunny April afternoon, she and her family gathered to watch Ethan’s first game of the season. It was a quiet day at Warren Park, maybe because locals had been up late watching Melanie’s beloved Blackhawks win an overtime playoff game. </p>

						<p> Ethan’s Cubs definitely don’t take after their major league counterpart. Down by two in the bottom of the final inning, they managed to claw their way to a comeback victory over the Edgebrook Mets. As the team met at the mound to celebrate, Melanie looked on proudly. She cherishes these types of moments knowing that without Ethan, she might not be here today. Sometimes Melanie still feels pain near where the bullet entered the left side of her chest. It serves as a vivid reminder of her past that nearly swallowed her whole. </p>

						<p> Wearing a beaded bracelet and a navy Cherokee Nation t-shirt, Patrick stood before the class smiling as his eager students repeated the phrases he taught them, sometimes stammering through the longer ones.

						<p> “Tla y-uganawa” means it’s not warm. “Dv-ga-hna-ni” means it’s going to rain. Patrick’s lesson included a game of “Simon Says” – in Cherokee, of course – that had his students singing, dancing and jogging in place. Immersion, he explained, is one of the most effective tools for learning a language. </p>
 
						<p> His students seemed to be there in equal parts to learn the language, have fun and support a young person from their community who is in touch with his culture. At 22, Patrick says he knows fewer than 10 people around his age with whom he can converse in Cherokee. </p>

						</div>
						<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">

						<p> According to US Census data, about 12,000 Americans speak Cherokee as their primary household language, and it recently became available as a language option on Android devices. Though Cherokee may not be in danger of going extinct in the near future, Patrick felt a personal obligation to learn it from an early age. </p>

						<p> Like most Americans, Patrick is of mixed heritage. He inherited an olive complexion from his maternal grandfather, whose family came to the United States from Southern Italy in the early 20th century. He feels more deeply connected, though, to his Cherokee heritage which comes from his maternal grandmother. “To me, it’s a culture and a way of life that makes sense,” he explains. Native people, in his experience, take care of one another. </p>

						<p> Though Patrick’s father is non-Native, it was his dad who bought him his first Cherokee language book when he was 9 years old. Twelve years later, the language now plays an important role in Patrick’s life. </p>

						<p> Toward the close of April's class, one young student raised her hand. "How do you say Ninja Turtle?" she asked, as the room erupted in laughter. </p>

						<p> "Ninja-daksi," Patrick replied with a smile. (There's no Cherokee word for ninja.) </p>

						<p> Though he cultivates a fun environment at his monthly classes, for Patrick, sharing the language is no joke. </p>

						<p> After Patrick completed his beginner book, he began taking language classes online, but it wasn’t until 2011, when he was 16, that he really experienced Cherokee first-hand. That year he traveled the 700 miles to Tahlequah, Oklahoma for the first time. Nestled at the foothills of the Ozark Mountains, Tahlequah became the capital of Cherokee Nation in 1843. According to legend, its name is derived from the Cherokee word "ta'ligwu,” which means “just two” and refers to the two tribal elders who selected the land as their home after the Trail of Tears. </p>

						<p> At the conference, Patrick attended a Cherokee language panel. Though he was still a novice speaker at the time, he understood enough of the language to decipher most of what the panelists said. One statement in particular stuck with him: “If we lose our language, we lose who we are.” </p>

						<p> “Here I am, light skinned. I don’t look Cherokee at all,” Patrick recalls thinking in that moment. “If I’m going to represent myself this way, I should learn the language.” And he has been ever since. </p>

							<p> At moments, Patrick feared he might never master it. Cherokee uses a syllabary, a key that functions like an alphabet of sounds, and it’s a very specific language. For example, the verb “to wear” changes depending on what article of clothing your subject is sporting. If he’s wearing a hat, the verb to wear is “agwalswetiga,” but if he’s wearing a shirt, the verb is “agwanuwa.” </p>

					<p>There are over 1,000 registered Cherokees in Chicago. Patrick says he doesn't know any who speak the language.</p>

					<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">


						<p> Though Illinois is home to over 1,000 registered Cherokees, Patrick didn’t know anyone back home who could speak the language. In order to really gain exposure, he enrolled in a two-year Cherokee language program at Northeastern State University, a school in the heart of Cherokee Nation that is home to more American Indian students than any other four-year public university in the country. </p>

						<p> Members of Chicago’s pan-Indian community have lots of different looks. “We come in all shapes, sizes and colors,” Patrick says. In Tahlequah, however, Patrick encountered strangers who were skeptical of his claim to be Cherokee – after all, celebrities from Bill Clinton to Miley Cyrus have claimed Cherokee blood – his language skills cleared the air. </p>

						<p> Many American Indian traditions are tied to specific places. For example, visiting the Stomp Grounds, religious gathering places where men dance as women keep rhythm, is one of the things Patrick misses most about Tahlequah. Nothing like the Stomp Grounds exists in Chicago. But language, Patrick contends, is a good way for urban American Indians to connect with their cultures even if they can’t participate in site-specific customs. </p>

						<p> Now back in Chicago, Patrick is a senior at DePaul University majoring in international studies with a focus on indigenous cultures. He hasn’t lost his connection to Tahlequah, however. Sometimes he even calls the tribe’s translators to ask them questions about the language just to get his Cherokee-fix. Ultimately, Patrick wants to work in tribal language revitalization, because he believes language is at the heart of ethos. “With the language comes all this knowledge of your landscape, your medicines, traditional knowledge,” he explains. “Everything is contained in the language.” </p>

					<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">

						<p> Though in many ways Patrick is fighting an uphill battle when it comes to spreading the language, that won’t stop him from trying even if it’s a matter of reaching just eight students at a time. He doesn’t have any students of Cherokee descent in his class, but he believes its important work, even if he’s working with non-Natives. </p>

						<p> “A lot of people think that American Indians don’t even exist, or that our languages are all gone, our cultures are all gone… we’re only something that can be studied in one paragraph of a history book,” Patrick says. </p>

						<p class="lead"> There’s a lake in southeast Ontario called Whitefish Lake. It’s two miles tip-to-tip and surrounded by forest. On one side, a tiny reservation town spans a few blocks along a main road. The other three sides open into wilderness – the kind of undeveloped land Canadians refer to as “the bush.” </p>

						<p> Jody Roy was born 37 years ago in that reservation town, known as Atikameksheng Anishnawbek to the Ojibwe Indians who live there. Her mom, a carpenter, built their home. It’s a tiny white and green house, one story with a basement, very old-school: reminiscent of a one-room schoolhouse from the outside, and at the turn of the Millennium, Jody’s parents still used rotary phones. “They don’t do the powwows or stuff like that,” Jody says, but she and her two older siblings grew up on the traditions of living off the land. Their vegetables came from gardens. Jody’s dad, a miner, hunted for their meat; he’d bring home moose and deer, accompanied by the occasional partridge, rabbit, or beaver. </p>

						<div class="col-md-4">


						<p> The lake allowed for a childhood spent outdoors: tree-hopping, camping, and swimming in that lake from breakfast to sundown. Jody, like all her other friends on the reservation, went to the Our Lady of Fatima Catholic school, a cluster of four buildings about 15 minutes away in nearby Naughton that only recently closed down after losing its funding. She and her siblings were raised by their two parents, but the 300-person town was so tight-knit that it was almost like every elder was a parent to every child. </p>

					</div> 
						<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3"> 

						<p> When Jody was 17, she met Eric Roy, a 21-year-old Ojibwe boy who had grown up in Chicago before moving to Canada. By the following year, in 1997, the couple had a daughter and named her Jade. When Eric’s brother offered him a commercial and industrial painting job in Chicago three years later, he couldn’t pass it up – and suddenly, the trio found themselves living next to a much larger lake, bordered by skyscrapers and the densely packed shoreline. </p>

						<p> The noise overwhelmed her. The airplanes overhead, cars on the street, and sirens would wake her up at night. Even the people were louder: She remembers trying to order Italian beef at Jeff’s Red Hots on North Cicero Avenue, and the guy behind the counter moving on to the next order because he couldn’t hear her. </p>

						<p> 15 years later, it’s home. Eric has a job in the city, and Jody and Jade are enrolled at Kendall College and Wilbur Wright College, respectively. But there’s value in a community that sees who you are – and Chicago just can’t quite provide that. </p>

						<p> In the city, there’s been economic hardship. The recession cut back Jody’s hours at the Anawim Spiritual Center for Native Americans in September 2011, and the Roys didn’t know how they were going to make ends meet. </p>


						</div>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-3">

							<p> On the reservation, there’s always a way to make ends meet. An ad for a temporary research assistant position in the reservation’s monthly newsletter brought Jody back to Whitefish Lake. She worked furiously to complete the contract so she could rejoin her family as quickly as possible; her return to Chicago in November was six weeks ahead of schedule. But don’t think she doesn’t realize the significance of her brief return: When times got tough, the reservation pulled her out and set her back on her feet. </p>

					<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">


 						

 						<p> In the city, there’s opportunity. Jade is graduating from Von Steuben Metropolitan Science Center in North Park, an excellent school by any metric. Mother can’t say for certain if her daughter would still be going to college if she’d grown up on the reservation. Jody has her own schooling plans as well, and once she graduates with a business degree, she and Eric hope to set up their own family-run paint shop. </p>

 						<p> On the reservation, there’s comfort. Jody and Eric plan on retiring someday to Whitefish Lake, to self-sustenance, to life in a Native community. Jody says they wouldn’t be the first to leave for a job and come back for retirement, nor would they be the last. “Why would you want to live in a busy hustle-and-bustle city when you’re old?” she asks, and to hear her say it, there’s no deeper meaning behind her intention: the quiet, familiar option will eventually become the better option. </p>

 	

 								</div>

					<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">


						<p> On the reservation, Jody’s Native identity has never been an issue. In Canada, growing up, brown-toned skin meant Native American. </p>

						<p> In the city, people regularly speak Spanish to her on the street – a language she’s never spoken in her life. Usually, she’ll just shake her head and say no. How else can you respond? A man once approached her during a church fundraiser to ask what kind of tacos she was selling; “Indian tacos,” she replied. </p>

 						<p> “You mean like the India Indians?” the man said. </p>

 						<p> “No, I mean like Native American Indians.” </p>

 						<p> “Are you Native American?” </p>

 						<p> “Yes.” </p>

 						<p> The man’s eyes grew large. “I thought all your people were dead with the dinosaurs!” he proclaimed. </p>

 						<p>  Now, Jody can only laugh about it – and all the other times it’s happened since. “I get kind of used to it,” she says, before pausing. “But it’s still mindblowing. It still strikes me that some people are unaware of it, you know?” </p>
