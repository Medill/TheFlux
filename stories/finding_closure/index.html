						<p>On a bright spring morning in Chicago&rsquo;s Montclare neighborhood, Marica Iza greets friends as they gather on the lawn in front of her tan brick two-flat. A cardboard cutout of a lifesaver rests against the concrete stoop, the words PRINCIPAL REDUCTION painted in red on a white and blue background. &#160;Iza&rsquo;s daughter, Elizabeth, passes out t-shirts, which the guests pull over their clothing. The shirts bear the name of their community organization, Centro Aut&oacute;nomo, and their logo, a snail in its shell &mdash; with a revolutionary fist where the head should be.</p>

						<p>Iza rents her home from Centro Aut&oacute;nomo, a community organization based in Albany Park, Chicago. Centro owns both the house and the land it&rsquo;s built on. The group bought the property for its community land trust, a non-profit program called Casas del Pueblo, which aims to take back homes owned by banks and the federal government and to provide affordable housing for members. The members have gathered here to both demonstrate and celebrate: After four years of battling foreclosure, Iza won the right to stay in her home. But even though Centro technically owns the property, members would say it belongs to Iza, and has for the last 14 years.</p>

						<p>When Iza bought this house, at the corner of Nottingham and Barry, in 2001, she saw it as a longterm investment for her young family. She hated the carpet and the ugly green paint on the walls but loved the big backyard and the second floor, which she hoped to rent out. The place had potential, as did Iza&rsquo;s future there. She set to work on the home. Her fingers bled as she knocked down walls and laid new tile, Iza recalls with pride. &ldquo;Every touch you see here has my energy there.&rdquo;</p>

						<p>But in the same space she toiled to create a home, she fought with her now ex-husband. She describes a decade of abuse filled with financial and emotional manipulation. When she filed for divorce in September 2010, her husband moved out and stopped making mortgage payments. Despite her attempts to negotiate with the bank, Iza&rsquo;s home fell into foreclosure. As her marriage fell apart, the life she had worked and fought for began to slip away.</p>

						<p>Stories like this are common among the members of Centro Aut&oacute;nomo. A divorce or illness creates a barrier to payment, and the bank, bound to standard operating procedures, forecloses the home with little warning. For Centro members, many of which are low-income, first-generation immigrants, homeownership has deep significance. It represents both financial and personal security they associate with becoming an American. Yet few of the working poor &mdash; those earning less than 80 percent of the median local household income &mdash; will realize these dreams. Only a quarter of this group, which often includes first-generation immigrants, manages to transition from renting to owning a home, according to a 2004 study from the Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology at the University of Washington. And even when those people get homes, 53 percent of them lose the property within the first five years of buying it.</p>

						<p>Cases like these are why Centro Autonomo started its community land trust, which would bring land and houses owned by banks under the control of the community: to form a permanent solution for those most affected by the housing crisis. Buying back Iza&rsquo;s home from the Federal National Mortgage Association &mdash; commonly known as Fannie Mae, the government-backed company that buys mortgages to sell to potential homeowners and investors &mdash; is Centro&rsquo;s first victory in that effort, one that has the organization&rsquo;s housing coordinator beaming as he shepherds people into a line for a demonstration on Iza&rsquo;s lawn. As he starts chanting through a megaphone, she and the others respond, their message clear: &ldquo;What do we do when the banks attack? Stand up! Fight back!&rdquo;</p>

						<p>Iza is the same. Her French-tip manicure is impressively even. She wears baby-blue slippers, embroidered with white daisy petals, to keep dirt outdoors. A former certified nursing assistant, she cleans homes for a living while she studies to become an MRI technician. She likes keeping things in order, and her home is no exception.</p>

						<p>As she points out different personal items in the living room, she smiles as compares the space to the cramped home her parents built in Quito, Ecuador. Between her father and mother, a police sergeant and a homemaker, and her seven siblings, there was little money to share, too. Hoping to find better work, one of her older brothers decided to immigrate to America, and in 1986, at the age of 19, Iza followed.</p>

						<p>But even though she had gained a financial foothold, Iza was still an undocumented immigrant. The unplanned birth of her daughter, Elizabeth, in 1991, caused her to worry about her status. Iza worried that, if she were deported, the two could be separated, since Elizabeth was a natural-born citizen. In 2000, a friend suggested a solution &mdash; Iza could marry a citizen, who could then sponsor her own application. The friend gave Iza&rsquo;s phone number to a potential match. She and the man spoke over the phone a few times and decided to meet. But there was little romancing, Iza says. He took her on no formal dates; both were looking to marry more for the financial benefits than for love. Iza didn&rsquo;t really care for the man, but he offered to sponsor her for citizenship. She saw this and a second income as a way to provide a better life for her daughter, now 9. Iza married later that year.</p>

						<p>In her mind, marriage was simply something you did to build a home. Iza had her daughter to consider, and having a husband, she reasoned, would give Elizabeth more stability. Part of building that home meant buying a house, which led Iza and her husband to buy the property in Montclare, in January 2001, with a down payment of $12,000 that Iza had saved.</p>

					<div class="col-md-5 col-sm-6">
						<p>Both she and her husband were named as owners on the title deed. On the mortgage, however, Iza waived her homestead right, following instructions given to her and her husband by the bank. Mortgage companies may ask for a spouse to waive this right so that, in case of default, it can more easily reclaim the property, since the loan is not split between two people. This subtle, handwritten waiver that Iza added below her signature gave her husband unilateral control over the mortgage. In the event of foreclosure, only he would be responsible to the bank. When they signed the mortgage, Iza says both she and her husband didn&rsquo;t fully understand the process of securing the loan, and they both just followed whatever instructions the bank told them to do.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-2"></div>
					<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-8">
						<p>This distinction of her being on the deed but not named as a borrower on the loan later became ammunition in a series of manipulations by her husband, Iza says, that grew into a decade of financial and emotional abuse. What started as subtle manipulations, such as hiding debt and limiting her spending, grew to more severe threats. When Iza began voicing her intention to separate, her husband responded, she says, by threatening to kill himself. Even after trying to reason with him, she says her husband threatened to call immigration and have her deported if she filed for divorce.</p>

						<p>With help from a social worker, she gained residency, in 2009, through a provision for immigrants in the 1994 Violence Against Women Act. The change in status gave her the security she needed to end the relationship, and in September 2010 she filed for divorce. &#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

						<p>Her husband retaliated, she says, by refusing to make the monthly mortgage payment. When Iza received notice of the missed payment, three months after her husband had stopped paying, she contacted Wells Fargo. She requested to assume the mortgage. As the legal spouse of the mortgagor and joint owner of the home, she reasoned, making these payments should be within her rights.</p>

						<p>Iza called every number at Wells Fargo she hoped would understand her situation. Both the English- and Spanish-speaking representatives told her that only her husband could make the payments. She eventually stopped telling the representatives her name, attempting to avoid the issue of her husband. &ldquo;I would say the property&rsquo;s address, they would hang up the phone. They would literally say, &lsquo;We have nothing to talk to you about.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Wells Fargo offered no comment on this last interaction.)</p>

						<p>After repeated attempts, Iza found a sympathetic ear. When she asked why she could not get any information from the bank over the phone, the representative said Iza&rsquo;s husband had set up a password on the account. This prevented Iza not only from making payments but also invoked protocols that prohibited the bank for even discussing the mortgage with her. Because Iza was not on the loan as a borrower, Wells Fargo says, the bank did not have legal authorization to discuss the account with her.</p>

						<p>In spite of her desire to make payments, Wells Fargo proceeded with a foreclosure in 2011; Iza attended her court date alone. A judgment of foreclosure was issued on July 1, 2011. Iza had lost her home. But just as her family collapsed, she gained a new one.</p>

						<p class="break">The Albany Park Autonomous Center, known by its Spanish name, Centro Autonomo, is a blip on a block of Lawrence Avenue crammed with multicultural establishments. Sandwiched between bakeries and a Chinese bridal shop, the small entrance leads to second floor offices that pulse with anti-capitalist propaganda. In the main office, an entire wall is covered with posters declaring, &ldquo;Autonomy is life/Submission is death&rdquo; and &ldquo;Capitalism is a pyramid scheme.&rdquo; The red slug with a fist for a head is painted on one of the mustard yellow walls.</p>

						<p>At the back left corner, Antonio Gutierrez, Centro&rsquo;s housing coordinator, sits at his cubicle. His thin black glasses give him a studious look and make him seem older than 26. The community organizer has a bright laugh, and even new visitors quickly grow comfortable chatting with him.</p>


						<p>Centro Autonomo serves the Northwest side&rsquo;s Latino community however it can. It offers English as a second language classes, computer training and workshops ranging from urban gardening to housing rights. Gutierrez helps with much of this, but most of his day is spent supporting Casas del Pueblo, Centro&rsquo;s community land trust.</p>

						<p>Starting a land trust is not a new idea in Chicago. Both the city&rsquo;s Department of Planning and Development and a community in the Humboldt Park neighborhood have created non-profit corporations that aim to take control of properties and make them available to low-income residents. Land trusts keep homes affordable by acquiring the land on which properties are built in long-term leases and then selling the house to community members. Since the homeowners are buying only the house and not the land, the homes sell for much less than market value. They also pay property taxes only on the value of the house, a significant discount from paying taxes on the house and the land.</p>

						<p>Centro Autonomo&rsquo;s land trust follows this basic concept but works using a less conventional method: It proposes that families be able to rent the homes from the land trust. Centro would own both the land and the home, and the rent would cover just taxes and insurance for the property as well as a maintenance fee. That fee would be placed in a savings account of sorts, which the renter could withdraw from to make repairs or improvements to the home. When the family decides to move out, it receives the money left over in the maintenance account. Centro&rsquo;s model would not only allow families to rent homes at prices far below the current market, Gutierrez explains, but also allow them to save and get ahead. &#160;</p>   

						<p>Like every program at the center, the housing program started based on a community need. Centro&rsquo;s guiding philosophy is to create an autonomous community, &ldquo;where people make decisions not as an individual but always thinking collectively and for the better good for that community,&rdquo; Gutierrez explains. He cites Zapatismo as a model, referring to the Mexican political movement that fuses elements of libertarian socialism, anarchism and Marxism. Yet because each person in the community is allowed equal sway over decisions, each iteration is uniquely tailored to the needs of its members. During the height of the foreclosure crisis, multiple members came forward with court summons they couldn&rsquo;t understand. So Centro Autonomo established a program to address the problem. This eventually became Casas del Pueblo, which began in 2011 under the previous housing coordinator.</p>

						<p>While Centro and the community land trust&rsquo;s governing decisions are quite deliberate, Iza encountered the organization by accident. On a day off from work, she stumbled into a workshop on foreclosure rights when the computer class she wanted to attend at Centro was canceled. </p>

						<p>Sitting in a makeshift circle of chairs in Centro&rsquo;s assembly room, she listened to families cry as they recounted stories like her own. They had fallen behind on mortgage payments because a family member had fallen ill and couldn&rsquo;t work; divorce had left mothers like Iza alone in their homes and struggling to support their children. Gutierrez says this experience is common at Centro. At the height of the housing crisis, the community land trust had more than 30 active cases and was coordinating protests almost every week.</p>

						<p>After hearing other families asking for help from Centro to keep their homes, Iza shared her story. The organizers at Centro took an interest in her case and selected it as one of the first causes of the community land trust. Soon Iza&rsquo;s solitary pleas for help became a throng of angry voices. After meeting the then-housing coordinator Roberto de la Riva and others, Iza attended a protest in front of the Wells Fargo building, in Chicago&rsquo;s financial district. She and 30 others marched west down Madison St., chanting for justice against big banks and waving bright orange and green signs that listed her address: 3066 N. Nottingham.</p>

						<p>The extra noise got the bank&rsquo;s attention. At the protest, Iza was able to deliver a letter explaining the circumstances of her divorce and her mortgage. Later that month, the communications department at Wells Fargo called Iza to notify her that it would look into her case. After a string of calls from collections and lawyers, Iza learned that her mortgage had been handed off to the Federal National Mortgage Association, commonly known as Fannie Mae.</p>

						<p>As the years went by and she had little progress to show for her effort, however, she struggled to maintain the momentum she had gained in Washington. Iza eventually became deeply depressed, in what she describes as her low point. She would break down crying during the middle of the day, sometimes finding it hard to even get out of bed in the morning. In addition to the financial and emotional stress of divorce and foreclosure, Iza feared social reprimand. During that period, she hid her foreclosure from friends, family and neighbors. Even trying to speak about it reduced her to tears. Her morning walks, normally a respite, became tinged with anxiety &mdash; that she would come home to a new notice, that her neighbors knew her embarrassing secret.</p>

						<p>&ldquo;Your eyes are trained on the door hoping there will be no sign, nothing hanging on the door. It was just like that, you feel like you're a criminal because you are being treated like one.

The company does not directly sell homes; instead, it sells them through real estate brokers. The realtor&rsquo;s job was to kick Iza out so he could sell the place. &ldquo;They don't come to your house and ask can you, &lsquo;Please leave your home.&rsquo; They don't do that. They will knock on the door very forcefully like they're going to knock the door down. Their plan is to harass you. Their plan is to make you afraid of them.&rdquo;</p>

						<p>When Iza came home from a walk one morning, the real estate agent and was waiting outside by the curb with two other men she didn&rsquo;t recognize. They watched her walk inside. Just as she had closed white metal screen door behind her, the men began banging on the frame. Centro Autonomo had taught her that she had no obligation to answer the door, and she concealed herself in her room, avoiding windows, as the men moved on to the side door, the other side door, the back. Iza&rsquo;s daughter hid in her room, clutching Baby, the family pit bull, for protection. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only way she felt safe.&rdquo;</p>

						<p>This was one of three major attempts to forcefully evict Iza from her home. Each interaction with the realtor put Iza in a panic, but she found strength and support through Centro Autonomo. &ldquo;They became my family,&rdquo; she says with pride.</p>

						<p>For two years, Iza continued to fight for home. At a market valuation just above $300,000, she could not afford to repurchase the property on her own. Her appeals for negotiation were denied, and a final notice of eviction was set for January 9, 2015. On that day, the Sheriff would be permitted to come into the house and forcibly remove Iza. She began packing her home of 14 years into boxes.</p>

						<p>But the week before the deadline, Gutierrez secured a final opportunity &mdash; he, Iza and a national coalition of community organizations would travel to the capital to meet with Mel Watt, the newly appointed director of Fannie Mae, and plead their cases. It was scheduled one day before her eviction.</p>

						<p>If the last meeting was a mere political formality, this session was genuine attempt at progress. Around a conference table in a small room at Fannie Mae&rsquo;s Washington headquarters, 15 people sat down for an intimate conversation with Watt. He listened to every story in full. </p>

						<p>Everyone who spoke was in imminent danger of losing their home, and many were immigrants. Iza cried as she listened to stories like her own, and some who had suffered even longer than her. </p>

						<p>Watt responded to each story. After the meeting, he spoke with each attendee to help address his or her situation. When he got to Iza, she took his hands in hers.&ldquo;I said to him, &lsquo;Mr. Watt, I'm not going home empty handed. You need to do something. By doing something with me you'd be doing something with many people who are in the same situation.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

						<p>Watt gave her the name of someone from the Federal Housing Finance Agency who, he assured, would help with her specific case. Fannie Mae gave Iza its final offer offer: Centro Autonomo could buy the house back at the reduced cost of $225,000 &mdash; $25,000 less than Fannie Mae&rsquo;s initial quote. She and Antonio decided the price was low enough and they accepted the deal.</p>

						<p>When Iza returned to Chicago later that night, she started unpacking the boxes. She wanted to feel that she hadn&rsquo;t given up, to finalize her victory. But most of all, she wanted to make her house a home again. And for the first time in four years, she could see an approaching end to her ordeal.</p>

						<p class="break">While the bottom floor of Iza&rsquo;s homeis well decorated and filled with personal items, there&rsquo;s still plenty of work she hopes to do. The basement is painted a plain, eggshell white, and save for a few stray tools the space is empty. It won&rsquo;t be much longer. This summer Iza&rsquo;s daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter will move in below her. The second floor also sits vacant, waiting for furniture. A couple is moving in next month, renting the upper floor. </p>

						<p>To help the transition, she began throwing away the mass of files she had kept documenting her foreclosure process. But she kept a few papers. Iza is saving them for her 1-year-old granddaughter, Arianna.</p>

						<p>She wants her granddaughter see the house&rsquo;s history and think, &rdquo;I have a piece of land in America that my grandmother fought for.&rdquo;</p>

						<p>Now that Centro Autonomo has secured her home, Iza feels ready to put the last 15 years behind her. There&rsquo;s still plenty to do. Iza feels safe with Centro Autonomo supporting her, but she&rsquo;s working toward a new goal now: to completely own her home. Gutierrez acknowledges that there&rsquo;s always a risk of default, and that if Centro Autonomo were to fall into financial distress, Iza could lose her home to foreclosure all over again. But between the grants Casas del Pueblo has received and the study abroad trips that Centro Autonomo facilitates, Gutierrez sees the organization&rsquo;s financial future as secure.</p>

						<p>And Iza&rsquo;s future brings opportunity, too. In the next five to 10 years, she will have the opportunity to buy back the property from Centro Autonomo completely. As she saves money from working and collecting rent from the flat upstairs, Iza comes closer to providing the stability for her family she always wanted. </p>
